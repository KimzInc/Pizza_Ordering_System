# Pizza_Ordering_System
Program 1: Pizza Ordering System

You have been tasked with creating a food delivery app for a local Pizza restaurant. The app is to be developed using Python and is required to do the following:
    • Allow the user to place an order for food items
    • Display the price for each item and the total cost of the order
    • Allow the user to select between pickup and delivery
    • Record the customer details including, name and address.

In addition, the following functionality has been identified as desirable and should be implemented where possible:
    • Allow the user to request a specific time for delivery if ASAP is not chosen
    • Allow the user to apply a discount code to get money off
    • Allow the user to select payment method of either cash or card
    • Record payment details
    • Store user details for later use
The program is to be implemented to work in a Python console application and should make use of the native Python libraries.
